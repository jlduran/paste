## Overview

PASTE provides scalability to concurrent TCP
connections by system call and I/O batching, multi-core scalability by
parallel, zero-copy data paths on a multi-queue NIC, and abstractions to build
storage stacks directly with packet buffers on regular or non-volatile main
memory.  It utilizes the kernel TCP/IP implementation that supports various
modern extensions.
PASTE provides both blocking and busy-polling, as well as protects the system
from application crash.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/micchie/paste/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
